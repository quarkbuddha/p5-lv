Description: LV - LV â™¥ lvalue
 This module makes lvalue subroutines easy and practical to use.  It's
 inspired by the L<lvalue> module which is sadly problematic because
 of the existence of another module on CPAN called L<Lvalue>.  (They
 can get confused on file-systems that have case-insensitive file
 names.)
